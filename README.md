## Tryout Sample Full Stack Web3 Application

Working along with Edge and Node's "The Complete Guide to Full Stack Web3 Development" by Nader Dabit to gain some insights on how to build a Web3 application.

This project follows the tutorial [The Complete Guide to Full Stack Web3 Development](https://dev.to/edge-and-node/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-web3-development-4g74).

# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
